# This is my program for Homework 1 of ITIN 8000
# The program is meant to take today's date and construct the parts of the date to print out
# "Hello. Today's Date is [Month Name] [Day Number][th/nd/st/rd] of [Year].
# The product of the month and day is [Month Number * Day], which is an [Odd/Even] number.
# If you counted the days this month so far you would have
# [Loop to count up to the current day of the month with each number on a new line] days.‚Äù
# This work was done by Kaitlyn Baysa in Fall 2021.

# Get today's date
# Assign the month number to variable
# Assign the month name to variable
# Assign the day number to a variable
# Assign the year number to a variable

# Validate day to add correct suffix
# If the day is equal to 1, 21, or 31 define suffix variable as "st"
# If the day is equal to 2, or 22 define suffix variable as "nd"
# If the day is equal to 3, 23 define suffix variable as "rd"
# If it is any other day define suffix variable as "th"

# Determine product of day and month
# Assign product as "even" or "odd"
# If the product of day number and month number modulus of 2 is zero (it is even) and define day_type as "even"
# Else define product_type as "odd"

# print the statement "Hello. Today's date is..." with variables
# include a new line

# create list of days with range
# print the statement "If you counted..." with the list of days
