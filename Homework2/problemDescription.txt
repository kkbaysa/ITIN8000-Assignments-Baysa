Problem Description
The project should simulate the operation of a restaurant. When I run main.py it should start by randomly generating a quantity for each of the menu items in the restaurant. These quantities will have to go down when customers order the menu items. Each customer order can contain an Entree, Side, Wine, and a Dessert.

Entrees (Random quantity between 1 and 6 of each)
- Chicken
- Beef
- Vegetarian

Sides (Random quantity between 5 and 10 of each)
- Soup
- Salad

Wines (Random quantity between 2 and 5 each)
- Merlot
- Chardonnay
- Pinot Noir
- Rose

Desserts (Random quantity between 1 and 3 each)
- Flan
- Creme Brulee
- Chocolate Moose
- Cheesecake

After generating the random quantities of each menu item the program should prompt the user to input a role and an action (this does not need to be done as a single input).

The roles and the actions each role can take are defined below

Waiter
Read Menu: lists how much of each menu item is available
What are the (Entrees/Wines/Sides/Desserts): lists how much of each of the chosen categories is available
Customer
Order (ordered food): takes an order from the customer and subtracts the order from the available food total.
Customers are told if what they ordered is not available and asked if they would like something else
Customers must be able to make their selection in any order and leave out choices. For example, they could just ask for Merlot or they could ask for Flan, Pinot Noir, Salad, and Beef
Random Choice
A random order is made using the choice function from the random module
See Chapter 11 of IP or 3.11 of the Python Cookbook
Manager
Close: Lists the remaining food at the end of the night and then sets all of the values to zero
Open: Restarts the main .py file and generates a new random amount of foods
